I was a teaching assistant at this course. My responsibility is to hold a 2-hour Q&A and discussion session every week. 

Efficient conversion of electrical energy is critical for electric and hybrid vehicles, wind and solar energy, power grids, computers, medical devices, and portables. This course teaches analysis and design of power electronic circuits for energy conversion, including circuit operation (converter topologies, steady-state modeling, switch realization), converter control (ac modeling, small-signal transfer functions, feedback), and magnetics (inductors, transformers). The course shares lectures with ECE/Energy Engineering 431, but has extended assignments. Prerequisite: ECE 230L or Engineering 224L or graduate student standing. Not open to students who have taken ECE 431 or Energy Engineering 431.
