I am so glad youâ€™re here. 

My name is Jinshui (pronounciated as *jeanshway*). Born in Shandong, having gone through journeys with lovely people in Tianjin and Xi'an, I now live in Carrboro, NC.

I am a PhD student at Duke University in [Brain Stimulation Engineering Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/bsel/home). I am advised by [Prof. Stefan M Goetz](https://stephanmgoetz.github.io/), and working closely with [Prof. Angel V Peterchev](https://bme.duke.edu/people/angel-peterchev/). My research spans on power electronics, signal processing, and neuroscience. 

Here on this website, you may find insights into my projects, thoughts on cutting-edge tech, and maybe a few unexpected ideas along the way. Please feel free to explore, reach out, and connect. The best way to reach me is via email: jinshui.zhang@duke.edu
