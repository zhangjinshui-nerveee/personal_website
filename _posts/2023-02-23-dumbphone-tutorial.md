In today's hyper-connected world, the idea of owning a dumb phone45a device that helps you stay disconnected45is appealing. However, modern "dumb phones" are often overpriced, limited in functionality, and let's face it, mostly serve as social status symbols rather than practical tools.

So, here's a better solution: turn your current smartphone into a "dumb" phone while keeping its essential functionality. This approach is cost-effective, practical, and allows you to remain somewhat connected without the constant distractions.

# Why Are Smartphones Distracting?

The answer is simple: apps. Notifications, infinite scrolling, and social media are engineered to grab your attention. Disabling notifications isn't enough because the apps themselves are always there, tempting you to check them. The solution? Don't install distracting apps in the first place.

# Convert Your Smart Phone to A Dumbphone
## Step 1: Perform a Digital Declutter

To determine which apps are truly necessary, I recommend reading Digital Minimalism by Cal Newport. This book offers practical advice for cutting out digital noise and deciding what truly adds value to your life.
Keep only essential apps. 
For me, that includes:
- Google Maps (for navigation)
- An email app (only for emergencies work)

Uninstall everything else, including social media, games, and any other app that doesn't contribute to your productivity or well-being.

## Step 2: Prevent App Reinstallation

Even if you uninstall distracting apps, there will come a time when you're tempted to reinstall them. The best way to prevent this? Block access to your app store.

Here's how:

1. Clean Your App List: Start by uninstalling all non-essential apps as described above.
2. Set a Password for Your Browser: this is a must do. Otherwise, your brain will find a way to download apps from browser soon.
3. Set a Password for Your App Store: Go to your phone's settings and enable a password for the app store.
4. Use a LONG, UNMEMORABLE Password: Choose a password that's long, complicated, and impossible for you to remember.
5. Store the Password Somewhere Inaccessible: Write the password on a piece of paper and store it somewhere out of reach (e.g., in a locked drawer or safe). Alternatively, give the password to a trusted partner or friend.

## Step 3: Enjoy Your New "Dumb Phone"

By following these steps, you'll transform your smartphone into a streamlined device that only serves essential purposes. You'll still have access to a good camera, maps, and navigation, but without the constant distractions of social media, notifications, and endless apps.

This way, you're not only reclaiming your attention but also enjoying the best of both worlds: the practicality of a smartphone with the simplicity of a dumb phone. Enjoy your real life!
