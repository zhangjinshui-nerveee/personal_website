I love exercise, and I want muscles to grow on me. To do that, I need a lot of protein.

Meat is rich in protein, but I eat very little of it in my daily life. Why?

Unfortunately, I’m not sympathetic enough yet to be a committed vegan. Instead, my main reason is concern over carbon emissions and global warming. I believe that "Your personal behavior eventually matters to the society."

Here is a list of common protein-rich foods and their carbon emissions. If you also want to be a green bodybuilder, you can refer to the following table to plan your diet.

| Food | Greenhouse gas emissions (kg) per 100 grams of protein | Calories per gram of protein |
| -- | -- | -- |
| beef | 49.89 | 8.30 |
| lamb | 19.85 | 10.1 |
| cheese | 10.82 | 15.8 |
| milk | 9.5 | 18.6 |
| pork | 7.61 | 9.9 |
| fish (farmed) | 5.98 | 4.72 |
| chicken | 5.7 | 5.3 |
| eggs | 4.21 | 11.8 |
| -- | -- | -- |
| tofu | 1.98 | 8.75 |
| grains | 2.7 | ?? |
| oatmeal | 1.91 | 24.1 |
| nuts | 0.26 | ?? |
| wheat & Rye | 1.29 | ?? |
| edamame | ?? | 12.4 |
| hemp seeds | ?? | 20 |
| peanuts (ground nuts) | 1.23 | 21.4 |

Here is my take on easily becoming a greener eater:
0. A firm **NO** to anything related to **COWS**
1. **REDUCE RED** meat consumption
2. All **VEG**etables are better than any kind of meat

> P.S. The data I’ve gathered only covers raw ingredients—packaging, transportation, cooking, etc., are not included. However, one thing is certain: local food is healthier and greener than anything that has traveled across continents. Find your local farmers’ market and enjoy!
