Cal Newport is Life-Changing

I love the idea of the craftsman mindset from his book So Good They Can’t Ignore You.

At first glance, it sounds familiar—work hard, and your life will improve. People like this idea because it aligns with the belief that ambition must be earned through effort. Otherwise, it’s just daydreaming.

But what sets the craftsman mindset apart from the conventional “work hard, and your dreams will come true” mentality is that it acknowledges something deeper: working hard for your daydreams is still a form of daydreaming.

1. Daydreams are plural. They shift and multiply, constantly pulling you in different directions.
2. You can’t work hard 24/7. Energy and time are finite.

So, face it. Instead of constructing grand visions of success, use your limited time and energy to refine the craft at hand—unless, of course, that craft violates certain fundamental rules (which I won’t elaborate on here). Convert your time into something tangible, something real, something you will be proud of or at least confident about on your resume. 

That said, while I find Cal Newport’s ideas compelling, I think his writing is too results-oriented. He presents arguments as if proving an objective truth rather than engaging in a nuanced discussion. I resonate with his ideas—not because he convinced me, but because I already agreed with them before reading his books. In that sense, he may not be a great writer, but he happened to articulate something I already believed.
