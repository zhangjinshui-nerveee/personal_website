Parallel-connectivity-enabled MMC offers advantages of sensorless voltage balancing and reduced output impedance.

Challenges arise in the form of current and voltage surges during and after equilibration.

We categorize parallelization behavior as uninterrupted (mainly thermal concerns) and interrupted (also causing voltage overshoot).

Mitigating stress involves using sturdier devices (e.g., Si or SiC with high thermal capacitance) and implementing solutions like differential mode choke for inter-module connections.
