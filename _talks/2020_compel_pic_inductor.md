Saturation of inductors causes the inductance drop and enlarge current ripple of the Totem-Pole PFC rectifier.

Signal decomposition property is used to analyze the current ripple and the influence of magnetic saturation.

Variable switching frequency scheme can eliminate the harmonics growth caused by the saturation of PIC inductors, so that smaller inductors can be used to replace the bigger ones with the same inductance
