In our study, we discovered a phenomenon in multilevel converters with paral- lel connectivity: the impedance of the logic submodule deviates from the ideally inverse proportional value with the output frequency. We proposed an analytic solution using ∆↔Y circuit transforming techniques. Results align with simu- lations and experiments, offering crucial insights into the impedance behavior of parallel-connected submodules. Interestingly, the variation in impedance ob- served in paralleled CH2B circuits mirrors uneven current distribution, akin to the ”skin effect” observed in conductors.
