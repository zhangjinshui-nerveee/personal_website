For transient over-loading applications, focusing only on steady thermal status leads to either failure during overloading pulses or over-designing of system. GaN transistorsâ€˜ compact package exacerbates the challenge.

We propose adding a copper mass between transistors and heat sink as a heat buffer to relieve the stress during the over-loading moments without over-designing the system.

Simulation and experimental results prove the thermal mass can extremely extend the operation boundary of a modular Magnetogenetic pulse generator and endure nearly 250 % more transient loss level.
