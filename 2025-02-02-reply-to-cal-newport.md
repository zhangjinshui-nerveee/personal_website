Cal Newport is life changing. 


This sounds familiar -- work hard and your life will become better. 

People like this idea because it tells you to work hard to deserve your ambition, something that is also referred to as daydreams when you don't work (hard) towards it.

The difference of craftsman mindset from the conventional "work hard and your dreams will come true", to me, is that this mindset realizes that 
working hard to make your daydreams come true is also daydreaming. 
1. daydream, is always a plural. Multiple, and changing alot. Following your daydreams may divert your effort frequently. 
2. You can't work hard 24/7. 

So face it, use your limited time and energy to focus on the craftsmanship on your hand (unless it's a violation of several rules, as follows) instead of constructing your daydreams. 
Convert your time to the material that you will use.

Plus, I think Cal Newport is good. But I do think his way of writing is to results-oriented. He is always proving something that he thinks is real instead of discussing it rationally. I like his ideas just because I intrinsically agrees with him. He didn't convince me, I already agreed on his ideas before reading his books. 
He is not a good writer but I happen to resonate with his ideas.

How to embrace the craftsman mindset as a (power) electrical egineer.
